# Architecture

## System Design

```mermaid
graph TD
    AdminUI["Admin UI\n(React)"] -- "HTTP REST" --> API["Go API Server\n(Chi)"]
    PlayerUI["Player UI\n(React)"] -- "HTTP REST" --> API
    AdminUI -- "WebSocket /ws/host/:code" --> WS["WebSocket Hub"]
    PlayerUI -- "WebSocket /ws/player/:code" --> WS
    WS --> GameEngine["Game Engine\n(Go goroutines)"]
    API --> DB[(PostgreSQL)]
    GameEngine --> Redis[(Redis\npub/sub + state)]
    API --> Redis
```

## Game Flow

1. Admin creates a quiz (questions + multiple-choice options)
2. Admin starts a session — gets a 6-digit room code
3. Players go to the join URL, enter the code + their name
4. Admin broadcasts questions one at a time with a countdown timer
5. When time expires or all players answer:
   - Players see "Correct / Incorrect" for 3 seconds (with points earned)
   - Admin screen shows the correct answer for 3 seconds
6. Leaderboard is shown to all (admin + players) after each question
7. After the final question, a podium (top 3) is displayed to everyone

### State Machine

```
waiting → active → question_open → answer_reveal (3s) → leaderboard → next_question
                                                                          ↓ (after last)
                                                                       game_over → podium
```

### Scoring

```
points = BasePoints × (1 - elapsed / timeLimit)
BasePoints = 1000, minimum = 0
```

Faster correct answers earn more points. Wrong answers earn 0.

## WebSocket API

### Host connects to

```
ws://host/ws/host/:sessionCode
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

### Player connects to

```
ws://host/ws/player/:sessionCode?player_id=<id>&name=<name>
```

### Message Types

| Type              | Direction       | Description                            |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `player_joined`   | server → all    | New player joined the lobby            |
| `player_left`     | server → all    | Player disconnected                    |
| `game_started`    | server → all    | Game has started                       |
| `question`        | server → all    | New question with options + timer      |
| `answer_submitted`| client → server | Player submits their answer            |
| `answer_reveal`   | server → all    | Correct answer revealed + points       |
| `leaderboard`     | server → all    | Updated leaderboard after question     |
| `game_over`       | server → all    | All questions complete                 |
| `podium`          | server → all    | Top 3 players podium                   |

All messages follow the format:

```json
{ "type": "<MessageType>", "payload": { ... } }
```
